ICYMI I’m currently hiring for two Senior Product Designers on the Ads & Promotions Team at DoorDash! (roles at bottom of post) Some folks have asked me for advice on landing a design position at DoorDash, so I thought I would share some things that have helped candidates stand out:

• In our current stage of growth at DoorDash, we build many 0-1 products and need strong generalist designers. This means that we look for people who demonstrate the ability to take on a wide breadth of design challenges and can work with different types of teams.

• One of our top goals is to improve design quality in our organization. That's why we look for folks who care about the details and showcase their strong design craft and user-centered methodology (not a process blow by blow, but actually applying the right methods for the challenge).

• At DoorDash you’ll have the freedom to autonomously identify opportunities and make a strategic impact. Because of this, having a strong rationale for your design decisions and being able to communicate that rationale to a variety of stakeholders are crucial.

• Finally, demonstrate how you take ownership to not only identify problems but drive solutions, and how you strive to improve everyday. These are 2 of the most important cultural values at our company that we look for in all future team members!
