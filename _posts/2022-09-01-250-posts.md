## simple way to generate post ideas:

1. Take Action

Every week you should be making moves:

- Upskilling by taking courses
- Reaching out to potential new contacts
- Having information interviews
- Building out projects
- Working your 9-5

2. Capture Ideas

After each action, write down your #1 learning or takeaway.

Keep a running list.

Parse it out to a weekly cadence.

3. Create Buckets

These are simple frameworks that you can drop ideas into.

For example:

- How To Do Something
- An Observation You’ve Made
- A Contrarian View You Hold
- Advice You Think Everyone Should Know
- Updates About Your Journey
- Etc.

4. Combine & Create

Now combine steps 2 and 3.

Look through your list of takeaways from last week.

Take an idea and combine it with a bucket.

Now turn it into a post.

5. Block Out Time To Write

Find an hour long block 2x / week.

Put it on your calendar and make it non-negotiable.

Aim to write 2-3 posts during each block.

If you do that every week?

You’ll have written 250 posts in the next 12 months.
